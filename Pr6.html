        A Tribute To <br>Srinivasa Ramanujan<br>
         (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician. Often regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.

    <h6>
        Srinivasa Ramanujan (born in India, 1887) was a mathematical prodigy with almost no formal training. His raw talent for numbers was astounding, and he independently figured out complex ideas. Recognizing his genius, British mathematician G.H. Hardy brought him to Cambridge. There, Ramanujan's work in areas like number theory and infinite series flourished, earning him recognition as a Fellow of the Royal Society. Sadly, his health declined, and he returned to India, passing away in 1920 at 32. Despite his short life, his notebooks are filled with thousands of original equations and theorems that continue to inspire and challenge mathematicians today. He's a shining example of extraordinary mathematical intuition.
